In July, 81 sub-national governments announced the 2050 Carbon Neutrality Joint Declaration and launched the Korean Local Governments’ Action Alliance for Carbon-Neutrality with an aim to bolster local governments’ leading role and spread the momentum of carbon neutrality and climate change action through collaboration. And, on the occasion of the P4G Seoul Summit, all 243 local governments will announce the 2050 Carbon Neutrality Joint Declaration for the first time in the world. With the joint declaration, all local governments of Korea will join hands to take a pivotal role in achieving carbon neutrality and addressing climate change. Minister Jeon Hae-cheol stressed that “Through participation and cooperation of local governments and residents, inclusive green recovery and sustainable economic innovation can be achieved at the same time, while realizing the vision for carbon neutrality.” “The Ministry of the Interior and Safety will give full support to explore and carry out innovative projects for promoting sustainable development and carbon neutrality in local governments,” he added.

portion of city-wide electricity generated by renewable energy sources to 100%
by 2050, the City of Orlando continues exploring opportunities to encourage
more implementation of low-cost, renewable energy generation solutions.
Given Orlando’s climate and geographic location, there are tremendous
economic opportunities and benefits for the city to become a leader in solar
energy generation and consumption, as well as to position itself as a hub for
clean technology industries and green jobs. In addition to economic benefits and
job creation, Orlando’s transition to more energy-efficient and clean, renewable
energy resources will also help minimize direct and indirect environmental
impacts, such as the reduction of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. It will also
help Orlando progress towards its goal of reducing GHG emissions by 90% from
2007 levels by 2040.
In May 2017, Mayor Dyer joined the Sierra Club’s Mayors for 100% Clean Energy
Initiative and expressed his support for transitioning the City of Orlando to
100% clean and renewable energy by 2050 citywide. In addition, Mayor Dyer
also signed the Under 2 MOU, a United Nations COP 21 commitment, to reduce
GHG emissions toward net-zero by 2050 and implement strategies to mitigate
a two-degree Celsius rise in global temperature from pre-industrial levels. This

Unlike Israel's original NDC, this new Decision includes an unconditional absolute greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reduction goal for 2030 of 27% relative to 2015 and an unconditional absolute GHG emissions reduction goal for 2050 of 85% relative to 2015. 
Whereas our INDC submitted in 2015 projected 2030 emissions would be 81.65 MtCO2e, under this update they are projected to be 58 MtCO2e by 2030.
This updated goal significantly improves upon Israel's first NDC which was presented as a per capita economy-wide unconditional GHG reduction. The previous target was 7.7 tCO2e by 2030 which corresponded to a total of 81.6 MtCO2e. The updated target presented in this NDC is 58 MtCO2e, which corresponds to a reduction of 23 MtCO2e or 29% in Israel' s total emissions. 
We believe that this updated NDC is a marked improvement both in the process by which the 2030 and 2050 national and sectoral goals were determined; in the more ambitious mitigation goal and in the work carried out to increase preparedness and adaptation to Climate Change.

* Sakhalin region to test Russia's first carbon market

* Net-zero plan far more ambitious than national goals

* Renewable energy and cleaner transport set for a boost

By Angelina Davydova

ST. PETERSBURG, Russia, Feb 19 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Fossil fuel-rich Russia may not be known as a leader on climate action - but in the country's remote far east, authorities have launched an unexpected experiment: an effort to try out carbon trading and reach net-zero planet-heating emissions by 2025.

The government of the Russian island region of Sakhalin, in the Pacific Ocean north of Japan, is planning tax breaks, charging stations and dedicated parking lots for electric vehicles, alongside a ban on all petrol and diesel cars by 2035.

Coal-fired power plants will be replaced with somewhat cleaner natural gas and hydrogen-fuelled passenger train lines developed in the region the size of Ireland, Sakhalin officials said, after their net-zero roadmap was approved by Moscow.

The Russian government - which has been criticised by green groups and analysts for setting unambitious climate action goals - in January gave a green light to Sakhalin's proposal for a pilot carbon emissions trading scheme, a first for the country.

The economy of the Sakhalin region, home to about half a million people, is largely based on fossil-fuel extraction, including coal.

According to its net-zero plan, an inventory of Sakhalin's greenhouse gas emissions and natural carbon sequestration potential will be carried out by August, before setting up an emissions trading system to start operating in mid-2022.

""This experiment will allow us to try various measures to regulate carbon and evaluate their effectiveness, for later scaling up at the national level,"" Russia's Economic Development Minister Maxim Reshetnikov said in an official statement.

""We hope that investors interested in 'green' projects, and companies willing to take on more ambitious climate targets, will be motivated to participate in the experiment,"" he added.

Sakhalin Deputy Prime Minister Vyacheslav Alenkov told the Thomson Reuters Foundation the region had taken the lead on the initiative, hoping to increase its investment appeal, improve quality of life and help solve environmental problems.

Besides emissions trading and expanding electric mobility, the region also wants to swap coal for lower-emitting natural gas, develop blue and green hydrogen production, and promote sustainable management of its extensive taiga forests.

About 97% of all coal mined there is currently exported, and coal could remain a reserve fuel for Sakhalin, if technologies were introduced to make the industry cleaner, Alenkov said.

ISLAND RENEWABLES?

As well as boosting gas for transport and homes - used now by about one-third of residents - there are plans to develop renewable energy, especially on the Kuril Islands, he added.

As the mountainous Sakhalin region is made up of nearly 90 islands, it is suitable for small-scale hydro, wind and solar power as well as geothermal energy, sources that are still under-developed but could improve energy access, Alenkov said.

An assessment of the opportunities for renewable solutions, including the technologies and funding needed, is due to yield its first results this year and investors are already interested, he added.

Sakhalin also hopes to develop cooperation with other emissions trading systems, including China, Japan and perhaps the European Union, and have its carbon credits approved for the international airline CORSIA offsetting scheme, Alenkov said.

Georgy Safonov, a climate policy researcher at Moscow's Higher School of Economics, said Sakhalin had high potential for bioenergy and renewables, urging the authorities to craft more robust plans for clean energy including green hydrogen, as well as to expand electric transport and forest carbon sinks.

NATIONAL AMBITION LOW

Vladimir Chuprov, head of Greenpeace Russia's energy programme, said Russia was 10 to 15 years behind global trends in regulating carbon emissions.

""It is only now we are getting to what many other countries have already realised,"" he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.

But as Russia's national emissions target does not require any real reductions, it will be difficult to build a nationwide carbon market due to a lack of demand for offsets, he added.

A draft of new carbon regulation legislation, which has been worked out over the last four years, does not include a carbon tax or a national emissions trading system, after heavy lobbying from industry, he noted.

Russia joined the Paris Agreement on climate change in September 2019, but its current climate policies and targets are way out of line with the pact's goal to limit global warming to ""well below"" 2 degrees Celsius above preindustrial times, according to research coalition Climate Action Tracker.

Russia's draft long-term low-carbon development strategy, due to be approved this year, is considered by many experts as unambitious, as it does not foresee reaching carbon-neutrality any time before mid-century.

The country's first emissions target under the Paris Agreement, approved by President Vladimir Putin last November, aims for a minimum 30% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 from 1990 levels, including the carbon stored in and released from forests and other ecosystems.

But Russia's emissions are already about 30% lower than 1990 levels, without taking forests into account, and just over 50% lower if they are included.

The economy ministry also said in late 2020 the focus for near-term climate policy would be energy efficiency measures, incentives and support for companies to invest in emissions-cutting projects, and an updated methodology to measure forest carbon.

Plans, announced last month, set a new target to increase energy efficiency by 30% from 2019 levels by 2030, after a previous 2020 goal was missed by a long way.

The new target will enable Russia to reduce its carbon emissions by almost half by 2030 from current levels, Deputy Minister of Economic Development Ilya Torosov told journalists.

Alexey Kokorin, director of WWF-Russia's climate and energy programme, said the Sakhalin experiment was possible because oil and gas companies in the region, including Shell, are keen to shrink their carbon footprint and start producing carbon-neutral LNG as part of the Sakhalin-2 project by purchasing offsets.

""The experiment is certainly good, but Russia also needs to reconsider its national emissions reduction target and make its climate commitments more ambitious,"" he added.",net-zero

1219,"Bringing forward our net zero
emissions target to 2022
Net zero emissions refers to achieving
an overall balance between greenhouse
gases emitted in operation and
greenhouse gases removed from the
atmosphere. Getting Dexus to net
zero is an opportunity to align with
changing customer sentiment and
meet the increasing investor demands
for low-carbon investments.
We have made great progress on our
goal already and have brought forward
our target to achieve net zero emissions
to 30 June 2022, advancing our original
2030 goal by eight years. Accelerating
our net zero ambition delivers strong
climate action for our planet, enhances
our vision and customer proposition
for smart, sustainable workspaces
and ensures we will be ready for other
opportunities, including supporting our
customers on their own journey.
Our commitment to deliver net zero
emissions by 30 June 2022 will be
achieved by:
1. Our transition to 100% renewable
electricity from base building
operations from July 2021, purchasing
renewable energy in the form of
Large-scale Generation Certificates
or GreenPower
2. Continuing to invest in certified
carbon offsets for our remaining
emissions. We will purchase
accredited nature-based offsets to
account for emissions from natural
gas, wastewater, refrigerants, and
waste/recycling
3. Verifying we are net zero and
maintaining this status through
Australia’s Climate Active carbon
neutral program
In parallel with this transition, our focus
remains on improving energy efficiency
and accelerating the deployment of
on-site renewables (see pages 56-57).
Transitioning to 100% renewable
electricity will account for around
80% of scope 2 and 3 emissions, with
the remaining 20% of scope 1 and 3
emissions to be balanced through
carbon offsets.
This includes emissions for the base
building sources comprising electricity,
natural gas, diesel, refrigerant leakage,
water and wastewater, and waste and
recycling. It excludes tenant sources
such as tenancy electricity.
Enriched Environment continued
Our approach on this journey involves:
– Reducing or eliminating emissions at
source through efficiency practices and
emission-free energy
– Investing locally, prioritising Australianbased projects with a geographic
correlation to the location of our
properties to support those local
communities
– Being transparent and verifiable, by
investing in certified renewable energy
and offset schemes, and certifying
and disclosing our outcomes with
independent verification
– Making a difference in Australia’s
transition, by supporting supply chains
and the development of renewable
energy and abatement projects
In line with the Oxford Offsetting Principles,
published by the University of Oxford,
we will shift towards ‘nature-based’
carbon removal projects over emission
reduction projects due to their ability
to actively reduce atmospheric carbon
dioxide. Initially we will invest in carbon
removal projects such as tree planting
and bush regeneration projects, which
use photosynthesis to capture and
sequest carbon from the atmosphere. As
technologies develop, we will also transition
towards projects that provide higher

This long-term ambition is complemented by intermediary targets for 2025 and 2030 and the commitment to maintain a trajectory compatible with well below 2°C.

Emissions related to energy generation and sales represent roughly 85% of ENGIE’s carbon footprint. Achieving Net Zero by 2045 will require a massive switch to decarbonized energy generation and green energy sales.

The procurement of goods and services accounts for 13% of ENGIE’s total footprint remains poorly understood. ENGIE had already set an objective of having all preferred suppliers with Science Based Targets by 2030 compared to 15% today. However, achieving net zero by 2045 will require engaging suppliers on a much greater scale. In a first step, ENGIE’s procurement organization across business entities globally is being upskilled on sector specific supply chain decarbonization opportunities and challenges, and how ENGIE can support suppliers in setting their own decarbonization goals and identifying collaboration projects.

Newcrest sets goal of net zero carbon emissions by 2050
Newcrest’s Purpose is “To create a brighter future for people through safe and responsible mining”.
This Purpose underpins our commitment to take on the challenge of climate change and to reduce our greenhouse gas (GHG)
emissions.
Our goal is net zero carbon emissions by 2050. Newcrest is taking action to manage climate change risks and opportunities.
In June 2019, we released our Climate Change Policy which outlined our commitment to the sustainable discovery,
development and production of gold and copper, together with our plans to identify, assess and report our responses to climate
change challenges.
This Policy continues to direct our actions to build a sustainable, resilient business which will thrive in a low carbon future,
encompassing:
• a better understanding of the life-cycle GHG emissions for the gold and copper value chains
• increasing the transparency of our climate change reporting of performance metrics and targets
• reporting our energy use, Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG emissions and our performance against targets annually
• working with our suppliers and customers to better understand our Scope 3 emissions
• ensuring that our measuring, reporting and verification processes are robust across all operating sites
• assessing options to increase our use of renewable power and low emission energy technologies
• focusing on opportunities to improve our energy efficiency to reduce energy used and reduce direct mining costs
• identifying and pursuing best practices in the mining and metals industry and partner with technology developers
• assessing climate change scenarios and the projected future price of energy in our medium to long term portfolio
analysis
• partnering with experts and research organisations to identify potential physical threats from climate change at our
current and planned operating sites and invest in appropriate adaptation responses to build resilience
• contributing constructively to policy development in our host countries.
In June 2019 we also set a target to reduce our GHG emissions intensity by 30% by 2030 against our FY18 baseline.
We are making progress.
• We have developed GHG Management Plans for each operating site to understand the abatement opportunities.
• We have directly linked achievement of the actions detailed in these plans to senior executive incentive payments.
• We are progressively improving the measurement of our GHG emissions across our full value chain.
• We are increasing our use of renewable sources of energy. For example, we have entered an agreement to purchase
40% of the energy requirements of our Cadia operation from a wind farm which is expected to be generating from
2024.
• We are well advanced in assessing the risks and opportunities for our business under selected climate change
scenarios in line with the Paris Agreement goals.
Newcrest now wishes to set a new longer-term goal, which is to achieve net zero carbon emissions by 2050. This goal will apply
to our operational (Scope 1 and Scope 2) emissions.
We will also continue working across our value chain to reduce Scope 3 emissions.
We will continue to be guided by our Climate Change Policy as we pursue this.

In order to achieve its targets, the Asahi Group will implement a variety of measures for saving energy and preserving the environment, including the proactive use of renewable energy, the recovery and use of waste heat, such as steam from the manufacturing processes, the application of cold energy, including energy gained through the normal-temperature replenishment of rows of cans, the introduction of cogeneration facilities, fuel conversion and activities that practically apply the ISO 14001 standard in all of its business establishments.
Asahi Carbon Zero has obtained approval from the Science Based Targets (SBT) initiative. SBT is a global initiative that validates if company-set goals for CO2 reduction are in line with scientific evidence.
In October 2020, we became the first corporate group in the beverage industry in Japan to join RE100. We aim to use renewable electricity in all our operations by 2050 and will further accelerate the introduction of renewable energy in the future.

The energy sector is the highest contributor of GHG in Liberia emanating mainly from the
use of traditional fuels such as firewood, charcoal and palm oil and the use of fossil fuels,
especially petroleum products. To reduce the reliance on traditional fuel and increase the
use of modern and renewable energy sources, the National Energy Policy (2009) was
developed with a set of goals targeted at maximizing efficiency, minimizing costs and
adverse environmental impacts as principle of extending energy access to all Liberians.
Most recently, Liberia’s Initial National Communication (2013) reinforces the National
Energy Policy with additional long-term targets and related activities, which includes:
• Reducing GHGs by at least 10% by 2030
• Improving energy efficiency by at least 20% by 2030
• Raising share of renewable energy to at least 30% of electricity production and
10% of overall energy consumption by 2030
• Replacing cooking stoves with low thermal efficiency (5-10%) with the higherefficiency (40%) stoves.
The long-term strategy of Liberia is to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050. The strategic
options for mitigation considered under the INDC are the energy sector (electricity,
transport) and the waste sector. The Waste Sector focuses on solid waste disposal on land.
In 2000, the waste sector accounted for about 0.60% of Liberia’s national total CO2 eq
emissions. A significant subcategory is CH4 emissions from solid waste disposal sites
(SWDS) on land, which contributed 91.7%. CH4 mitigation targets will include landfill
recovery, waste incineration with energy recovery, composting of organic waste,
controlled wastewater treatment, and recycling and waste minimization.",reduction

Continuing to improve the fabric efficiency of our homes and incorporating low carbon technologies (scope 3 target). We will also look to monitor the in-use performance of our homes to help drive further improvements.

We have estimated this target to be 313 MtCO2e (excl. LULUCF) by 2030.

This new target is 26% below Argentina’s previous NDC target, which provided an unconditional target limiting 2030 emissions to 422 MtCO2e (excl. LULUCF). Argentina’s second NDC covers emissions from all sectors and covers CO2, CH4, N2O, HFCs and PFCs. The country’s previous NDC also covered sulfur hexafluoride (SF6).

This new target represents an increase in emissions of 35% above 1990 levels and a 2% decrease below 2010 levels (excl. LULUCF).

As discussed in more detail in the following
section, in FY2021, our equity Scope 1 and Scope 2
emissions were 16,391 kt CO2-e, a decrease of
eight per cent on FY2021, and 10 per cent lower
than our FY2017 baseline.
Our total Scope 3 emissions reported
under our SBTi-approved emissions reduction
target increased by four per cent in FY2021 to
22,347 kt CO2-e, and were 19 per cent lower
than our FY2017 baseline, largely reflecting lower
output from our owned and contracted generation
resulting in an increase in net electricity purchases
from the NEM and external sources, partly offset
by a reduction in domestic gas sales at Australia
Pacific LNG primarily due to the roll off of legacy
contracts. Further details are provided in the
following section.

The world is rapidly accelerating towards a
lower-emissions future, and we will play an
important role in that transition. We will help

the economy.

business. In 2017, we became the first company in

developed with a set of goals targeted at maximizing efficiency, minimizing costs and adverse environmental impacts as principle of extending energy access to all Liberians.
Most recently, Liberia’s Initial National Communication (2013) reinforces the National Energy Policy with additional long-term targets and related activities, which includes:  
• Reducing GHGs by at least 10% by 2030
• Improving energy efficiency by at least 20% by 2030
• Raising share of renewable energy to at least 30% of electricity production and
10% of overall energy consumption by 2030
• Replacing cooking stoves with low thermal efficiency (5-10%) with the higherefficiency (40%) stoves.
The long-term strategy of Liberia is to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050. The strategic
options for mitigation considered under the INDC are the energy sector (electricity,
transport) and the waste sector. The Waste Sector focuses on solid waste disposal on land.
In 2000, the waste sector accounted for about 0.60% of Liberia’s national total CO2 eq
emissions. A significant subcategory is CH4 emissions from solid waste disposal sites
(SWDS) on land, which contributed 91.7%. CH4 mitigation targets will include landfill

SCOR believes that the carbon footprint is more meaningful

matters most. For these reasons and despite some weaknesses in
the current data, SCOR has decided to set Carbon Intensity

(Pg. 69) 2030 Goal: Scope 1 and 2 GHG Emissions
Description. Drive a 10% reduction in our absolute Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions from 2020 to 2030.
Baseline. Progress measured as percent reduction from our calendar year 2019 emissions. Our combined Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG emissions in 2019 were 2.88 million metric tons of CO2e.
Progress in 2021. During 2021, our Scope 1 and 2 emissions increased by approximately 14% from the 2019 baseline.
Looking Ahead. In 2022, we will continue to take action to reduce emissions through abatement, investments in renewable electricity, process and equipment optimization, and energy conservation.
In addition to this 2030 goal, in April 2022 we announced a new commitment to reach net zero Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions by 2040. Next year we will begin reporting progress toward both the 2030 and 2040 commitments. ",net-zero
