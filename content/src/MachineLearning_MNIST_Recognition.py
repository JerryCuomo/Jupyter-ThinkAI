# This code was autogenerated by GPT-4, from the following prompt:
# Prompt: Generate the simplest python program to illustrate deep learning in action.
#
# About: This program demonstrates basic digit recognition using the TensorFlow library. 
# It involves loading the MNIST dataset, preprocessing data, defining a neural network model, 
# training the model, and evaluating its performance. The model's architecture is beginner-friendly.
#
# Setup: Python installed with TensorFlow. Install using 'pip install tensorflow'.

import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.datasets import mnist
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense, Flatten
from tensorflow.keras.utils import to_categorical

# Load the MNIST dataset
(train_images, train_labels), (test_images, test_labels) = mnist.load_data()

# Normalize the images
train_images = train_images / 255.0
test_images = test_images / 255.0

# Convert labels to one-hot encoded format
train_labels = to_categorical(train_labels)
test_labels = to_categorical(test_labels)

# Build the model
model = Sequential([
    Flatten(input_shape=(28, 28)),
    Dense(128, activation='relu'),
    Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])

# Compile the model
model.compile(optimizer='adam',
              loss='categorical_crossentropy',
              metrics=['accuracy'])

# Train the model
model.fit(train_images, train_labels, epochs=5)

# Evaluate the model
test_loss, test_acc = model.evaluate(test_images, test_labels)
print(f"Test accuracy: {test_acc}")
