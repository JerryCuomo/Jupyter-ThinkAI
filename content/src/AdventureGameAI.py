# Prompt: Determine the interaction outcome between a character and the player in a text adventure game.
#
# About: This script models decision-making in a text adventure game. It evaluates various factors like 
# the character's knowledge of the player, reputation, possession of items, and actions to determine the 
# character's response during an interaction.
#
# Setup: Python installed. No additional packages required.
